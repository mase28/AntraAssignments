1. What type would you choose for the following "numbers"?
	- A person's telephone number: int
	- A person's height: float
	- A person's age: int
	- A person's gender: byte
	- A person's salary: double
	- A book's ISBN: long
	- A book's price: float

2. What are the differences between value type and reference type variables? What is boxing and unboxing? 
	The difference between a value type variable and a reference type variable is that a value type variable holds
	its own data in its memory allocation in the stack whereas a reference type data is a memory address in the 
	stack that points to some data in the heap. 

	Boxing is the act of casting a variable type to the variable type object where it is then stored on the heap. 
	Unboxing is then casting an object type into a value type variable on the stack.

3. What is meant by the terms managed resource and unmanaged resource in .NET?
	Managed resources are maintained by the garbage collector and will free the memory at the end of runtime whereas
	unmanaged resources are not recorded by the garbage collector and will cause leaked memory if not freed. 

4. Whats the purpose of Garbage Collector in .NET? 
	C# requires manual memory allocation and deallocation for data usage by the program. Thus the purpose of the 
	Garbage Collector is to take some of the responsiblities of memory management off of the programmer by 
	allocating and freeing memory automatically.
